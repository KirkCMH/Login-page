## 🧠 Layout Approach & Structure

The layout is built using:

- **Semantic HTML5** for accessibility and structure.
- **Pure CSS** for styling and animations.
- **Responsive units and `flex` layout** to ensure mobile-friendliness.
- **Floating labels** using `:placeholder-shown` and label positioning.
- **Password strength validation** with rule-based conditions and icons.

### Structure Overview:

/images/ -> Icon assets (e.g., check.svg, un-check.svg, eye.svg)
index.html -> Main HTML file with all form markup
style.css -> Custom styling for layout, inputs, and states
script.js -> Handles live validation and interactivity

## 🤖 AI Assistance Disclosure

Some parts of this project were assisted by ChatGPT, specifically for:

- Writing accessibility-conscious HTML structure.
- Writing CSS logic for floating labels and password validation styling.
- Generating JavaScript for rule-based validation logic (e.g., minimum length, contains number).
- This README.md basic structure.

All generated code was reviewed and manually refined to ensure maintainability and clarity.
